# EsiCoin Comprehensive Road Map

## RM1: EsiCoin Overview

**EsiCoin (EIC)** is a cryptocurrency designed for a decentralized ecosystem that supports various use cases such as employee wages, payments, decentralized exchanges, and more. EsiCoin will be integrated with blockchain technologies such as Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and others, enabling interoperability and scalability.

### Key Features:
1. **Blockchain Integration**: EsiCoin will leverage blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain to ensure scalability, decentralization, and secure transactions.
2. **Decentralized Ecosystem**: EsiCoin will function in a decentralized ecosystem where users can mint, trade, and transfer EsiCoins with minimal restrictions.
3. **Stablecoin Integration**: A stablecoin integration system will be implemented to allow users to convert their EsiCoins to stablecoins such as USDT or USDC for wage payments, ensuring stability for employees' earnings.
4. **Security Features**: EsiCoin will incorporate strong security protocols, including multi-signature wallets and smart contract audits to ensure that funds and transactions remain secure.

## RM2: Supply Caps and Coin Management

EsiCoin's total supply is capped at **1 billion EIC coins**, with specific allocations and minting rules for various use cases, ensuring liquidity, scalability, and stability within the ecosystem.

### 1. **EsiCoin Supply Cap Breakdown:**

- **1 Billion EIC Total Supply**: The total number of EsiCoins that will ever be created is capped at 1 billion.
- **Employee Salary Minting (Stablecoins)**: EsiCoins will be minted to match the amount needed for salary payments, based on employee agreements. Employees can convert their EsiCoins into stablecoins (e.g., USDT) or use them for other transactions within the ecosystem.
- **Transaction Fees**: There will be no transaction fees charged by EsiCoin directly. Fees will be defined by the respective stablecoin networks (e.g., USDT network fees).
- **Insurance and Security Fund**: A fund for insurance and security will be allocated, where approximately **25 million EIC** coins will be minted as needed to cover such expenses.
- **Development and Community Incentive Funds**: Separate funds will be allocated to incentivize development, attract contributors, and support community growth. This includes rewards for early adopters, and project promoters.
  
### Minting Process:
- Minting will occur on-demand, meaning new EsiCoins will be minted as necessary to cover specific requirements such as employee salaries, rewards, and staking payouts.
- Each fund or minting decision will be approved and managed by the project team, ensuring a transparent and accountable process.

## RM3: Key Ecosystem Features

### 1. **User Wallets**:
- EsiCoin users will have access to a secure wallet system that supports EIC, stablecoins (such as USDT), and other cryptocurrencies.
- The wallets will be available as web-based wallets, mobile wallets, and potentially cold wallets for long-term storage.

### 2. **Education Platform**:
- Users will have access to educational resources about blockchain technology, cryptocurrency usage, and how to utilize EsiCoin in real-world applications.
- This will include tutorials, articles, FAQs, and an active community forum for discussions.

### 3. **Governance Model**:
- EsiCoin's governance model will be decentralized, with voting rights distributed to token holders, allowing the community to influence the decision-making process on key protocol changes.
- **Proposal Mechanism**: Users can submit proposals for the community to vote on key decisions, such as protocol updates, partnerships, and system upgrades.

### 4. **Partnerships and Collaborations**:
- EsiCoin will collaborate with other blockchain networks and projects to ensure its broad adoption and real-world utility.
- Partnerships with companies offering stablecoins (e.g., Tether) will be explored to facilitate the use of EsiCoin for payroll purposes.

## RM4: NFT Platform

EsiCoin will allow users to create, trade, and mint Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within its ecosystem. The NFT platform will be open to creators, enabling them to monetize their work and engage in the growing NFT market.

### Key Features:
1. **NFT Creation**:
   - Users can create NFTs by uploading digital content such as artwork, videos, or any other media.
   - The platform will allow creators to set royalty fees that are paid out to the original creators whenever an NFT is sold or resold.
   - Royalties will be defined in the NFT metadata and will automatically be transferred to the creator when a sale occurs.

2. **NFT Marketplace**:
   - Users can list, buy, and sell NFTs directly on the EsiCoin platform or integrated decentralized exchanges.
   - Sellers will be able to set a price for their NFTs, and buyers will pay the agreed amount in EsiCoin or stablecoins.

3. **NFT Transfer Fee**:
   - A small fee will be charged for transferring NFTs outside the EsiCoin ecosystem, such as transferring NFTs to external wallets or platforms. This fee will be determined by the network used for the transfer (e.g., Ethereum or Solana) and not by EsiCoin.

4. **NFT Importation Fee**:
   - An importation fee will be applied when importing NFTs from external wallets or platforms into the EsiCoin ecosystem. This fee will be slightly higher than the transfer fee.

5. **Verification and Fraud Prevention**:
   - All creators will be required to verify their identity before minting and selling NFTs. Verification will help prevent fraud and ensure authenticity.
   - NFTs created by multiple collaborators (e.g., artists) must be verified by all parties involved to ensure proper royalty distribution.

6. **Royalty Cap**:
   - A royalty cap of **100,000 EIC** will be set to prevent excessive royalty payments on a single NFT. This ensures fairness and sustainability in the ecosystem.

## RM5: Future Plans

### 1. **Blockchain Expansion**:
- EsiCoin will continue to explore partnerships with other blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain) to integrate with their ecosystems for cross-chain functionality.

### 2. **Stablecoin Integration**:
- EsiCoin will partner with major stablecoins like Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and others to provide a stable payment option for employees. This will allow users to convert EsiCoin into stablecoins for salary payments and future transactions.

### 3. **QR Code Wallet**:
- A QR code-based wallet system will be developed, allowing users to easily check their balances and send/receive payments using EsiCoin and other supported tokens.

### 4. **User Education & Documentation**:
- The education platform will be expanded to include more detailed guides, video tutorials, and advanced resources for users and developers interested in EsiCoin and blockchain technologies.
- EsiCoin will also create an extensive FAQ section and provide live support for users who encounter issues.

### 5. **Transaction Audits**:
- Audits will be conducted regularly for every minting event and large transactions. This ensures transparency and accountability in the minting process and financial transactions.

## RM6: Governance

- Governance will be decentralized, with token holders actively participating in the decision-making process.
- **Proposal System**: Token holders can submit proposals, which will be voted on by the community to determine the direction of the project.
- **Voting**: Each token holder will receive voting rights proportional to their holdings, giving them the ability to influence protocol changes, governance decisions, and project partnerships.
